# Borcelle Digital Wallet Financial Analysis
## Project Overview
https://github.com/WariebiAde/myprojects.github.io
The Borcelle Digital Wallet Dashboard is a web-based financial interface designed to give users a clear, real-time view of their account balance, card details, and transaction history. The dashboard prioritizes clarity, accessibility, and efficiency, enabling users to quickly understand their financial position and take immediate action without friction.

This project demonstrates how well-structured data presentation and intuitive UI design can improve financial awareness, user trust, and decision-making.

Problem Statement

Many digital banking users struggle with:

Information overload on financial dashboards

Difficulty tracking recent transactions and spending patterns

Poor visual hierarchy that slows down decision-making

The goal of this project was to design a dashboard that surfaces essential financial data at a glance, while still allowing users to drill down into detailed transaction information when needed.

Solution

The Borcelle dashboard solves these challenges by:

Centralizing key financial metrics (total balance, card status, membership level)

Displaying transactions in a clean, chronological format with clear status indicators

Providing quick-action buttons for common tasks such as top-up, history review, printing, and sharing

The result is a streamlined dashboard that supports both quick checks and deeper financial review.
